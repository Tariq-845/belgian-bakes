## Features
- __Navigation Bar__
    - Currently on all four of our pages we feature a fully responsive sidebar that includes Home page, Recipes page, About page and finally Contact page. We decided on a sidebar over a regular navbar as we feel it fits better with the aesthetic and gave it a contrasting colour for better accessibility.

- __Recipes__
    - We have recipe lists, which includes ingredients and step-by-step instructions for our users to follow along and create some of our amazing food. They can also share their results on our social pages.

- __Map__
    - We have embedded a map in our contact page for users to easily find the location of our store. It fits better in the contact page as that's where users expect all the company's contact information to be.

### Features Left to Implement
- __Link to Shopping List__
    - We are working on a feature that allows users to find specific ingredients that we've used at their local stores so users have a better experience when baking.
- __Sign In/Up - User Accounts__
    - Allowing users to create accounts for more personalisation.
- __Saving Option__
    - This feature will allow users to save their favourite recipes on our website for later use.
